### OAuth
[What is OAuth Exactly](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth) 

OAuth is a delegated authorization framework for REST/APIs. It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user’s data without giving away a user’s password. It decouples authentication from authorization.

> To begin at a high level, OAuth is not an API or a service: it’s an open standard for authorization and anyone can implement it.
